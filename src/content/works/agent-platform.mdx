## Introduction

This project is a continuation of my previous project [API Gateway for AI Agents](/works/api-gateway-for-ai-agents).

I made project in order to observe:
1. who made a request
2. what the query prompt is
3. what tools are being used and what their outputs are
4. how long a request takes until completion
5. what the agent response is
