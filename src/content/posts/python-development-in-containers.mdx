Before we go further, read [my previous post](/posts/web-development-in-containers)
about how to setup our web development environtment in docker.
Perhaps that post would make you a little familiar 
the goal of this entire post.

# Introduction

Say that you want to develop a prototype in Python without 
desacrate your local environment with packages that we
are not sure capable of removing. Let's create
a docker environment so that you can install any required dependencies.

By the end of this post, you would be able to:
1. Create a container image
2. Deploy the development environment as a container
3. Remove deployment

Let `uv` be our Python package manager and let's
make a docker image with `uv` in it.

# Image Creation

To keep the image size small, choose images
with tags that have `slim-bookworm` or `alpine`.
In this case, we are going to use `3.12-slim-bookworm`.

```yaml title=Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app
```

For more options, please visit the python docker hub [repo](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).

Then run `docker build -t python-uv:latest .`.
If you are using `podman`, then run `podman build -t python-uv:latest .`.

# Deployment

Once we have our own image, let create a compose file to deploy it.

## Compose Version 1

```yaml title=compose.yaml
services:
  uv-dev:
    container_name: uv-dev
    image: python-uv:latest
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      - ./.python-version:/app/.python-version
      - ./pyproject.toml:/app/pyproject.toml
    restart: always
```

If you chose to build the image in the `compose.yaml` file,
let's modify compose file a little bit.

## Compose Version 2

```yaml title=compose.yaml
services:
  uv-dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: uv-dev
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      - ./.python-version:/app/.python-version
      - ./pyproject.toml:/app/pyproject.toml
    restart: always
```

Choose one out of those versions above, and run `docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d`
to deploy this environment. If not, run `podman compose -f compose.yaml up -d`

# Development

Before doing some development, we need to install
an extension called **Dev Containers** on VS Code.

Once it's installed, press <kbd class="kbd">ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">p</kbd>
to toggle a search bar and type "dev containers attach to" into it.
Press <kbd class="kbd">enter</kbd> and find the name of your development container.

# Conclusion

Once you're done with the development, you could just
run `docker compose down` or `podman compose down`, and the environment would be removed.
