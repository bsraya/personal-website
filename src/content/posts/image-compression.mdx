## {frontmatter.title}

This is the first post of the series "Image Processing and Optimization", and we will explore different ways to process and optimize images using C++ or Python in this series.

In this post, we are going to learn on how to minimize the size of an image by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
With SVD, we are going to find the least number of singular values that can be used to reconstruct an image.
The less number of singular values we keep, the smaller the size of our image will be.

For this example, we are going to use the raccoon image from `scipy`.

```python
from scipy import datasets
from numpy import linalg
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Then we import the image of a raccoon from `scipy` library.

```python
raccoon = datasets.face()
plt.imshow(raccoon)
```
