I have been using `asdf`, a version manager for every tool (e.g. Node,js, Ruby, MySQL, you name it) for years.
It was great since I could manage multiple versions of the same tool.
I could switch between versions easily.
I could even have different versions of the same tool in different projects.

There is nothing wrong with `asdf`.
I thought to myself, "Is there a way to serve my web applications more efficiently?"
Since I've been tinkering with Docker, maybe I could serve my web app with Docker
and mount the working directory to the container so that any changes I make in the working directory
would reflect in the container.

By serving the web app with a container, I do not have to go to the working directory, run and stop the server.
As soon as I turn on my computer, the server is already running.

To do this, go to your working directory and create `compose.yaml` and `Dockerfile`. 

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM oven/bun:alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN bun install
```

1. `FROM oven/bun:alpine` - This line sets the `node` image with the tag `current-alpine3.19` as the base image for this container.
2. `WORKDIR /app` - This line sets the working directory to `/app`.
3. `COPY . /app` - This line copies everything in the working directory to `/app`.
4. `RUN bun install` - This line installs the required dependencies in the container.

By default, Astro.js web applications are served on port 4321.

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: webapp
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/webapp:/app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 4321:4321
```

1. `webapp:` - This is the name of the service.
2. `build:` - This tells Docker to build the image.
3. `context: .` - This tells Docker to use the current directory you defined in `Dockerfile` above.
4. `dockerfile: Dockerfile` - This tells Docker to use the `webapp.dockerfile` we just defined above.
5. `container_name: webapp` - This is the name of the container, you could name whatever you like.
6. `volumes:` - This tells Docker to mount the working directory to the container. (Use `pwd` on your terminal if you are sure about the path you're currently on).
7. `restart: always` - This tells Docker to restart the container if it crashes.
8. `ports:` - This tells maps the port 4321 in the container to the port 4321 on your computer.

To start the server, run `docker compose up -d` in your terminal. `-d` means *detached* mode, meaning the container will run in the background.

If you are using `podman`, run `podman compose up -d`.

To make sure, go to your browser and access `http://localhost:4321`.

If there are some files that you do not wish to be copied into the container,
do add `.dockerignore` into your codebase.

```text title=".dockerignore"
.astro/
node_modules/
...
```

If you need to import some environment variables, there are two ways
you could consider.

1. Raw-dogging the environment values in the compose file like a real man.

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: webapp
    environment:
      - DEBUG=TRUE
      - ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/webapp:/app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 4321:4321
```

2. Import `.env` file inside the compose file.

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  webapp:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: webapp
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/webapp:/app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 4321:4321
```

That way would import the `.env` file in the current working directory into the container.
