## Introduction

In the [Mathematics of Gradient Descent](post), we have discussed what Gradient Descent is, how it works,
and how to derive the equations needed to update the parameters of the model.

In this post, we are going to write Batch Gradient Descent from scratch in Python.

## Setting Up The Dataset

Throughout this series, we are going to use the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from UCI Machine Learning Repository imported from `scikit-learn`.
There are two features in the dataset that we are going to analyse, namely `sepal_length` and `petal_width` shown in the highlighted lines.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = datasets.load_iris()
features = iris.data
target = iris.target

sepal_length = np.array(features[:,0])
petal_width = np.array(features[:,3])

species_map = {0: 'setosa', 1: 'versicolor', 2: 'virginica'}
species_names = [species_map[i] for i in target]
```

## Setting Up A Baseline

Before we implement Batch Gradient Descent in Python, we need to set a baseline to compare against our own implementation.
So, we are going to train our dataset into the Linear Regression built-in function made by `scikit-learn`.

First, let's fit our dataset to `LinearRegression()` model that we imported from `sklearn.linear_model`.

```python
linreg = LinearRegression()

linreg.fit(
    X = sepal_length.reshape(-1,1),
    y = petal_width.reshape(-1,1)
)

print("Intercept: ",linreg.intercept_[0])
# Intercept: -3.200215
print("First coefficient:", linreg.coef_[0][0])
# First coeficient: 0.75291757
```

Once we have the intercept and the coefficient values, let's make a regression line to see if the line is close to most data points.

```python
sns.scatterplot(
    x = sepal_length,
    y = petal_width,
    hue = species_names
)

plt.plot(
    sepal_length,
    linreg.intercept_[0] +
    linreg.coef_[0][0] * features[:, 0],
    color='red'
)
```

Clearly, the line is indeed very close to the most data points and we want to see the MSE of this regression line.

```python
linreg_predictions = linreg.predict(sepal_length.reshape(-1,1))
linreg_mse = mean_squared_error(linreg_predictions, petal_width)
print(f"The MSE is {linreg_mse}")
# The MSE is 0.19101500769427357
```

From the result we got from `sklearn`, the best regression line is

$$
  y = -3.200215 + 0.75291757 \cdot x
$$

with MSE value around $0.191$. The equation above is going to be our base line for this experiment to determine how good our own Gradient Descent implementation.

## Mathematics of Batch Gradient Descent

The parameter update rule is expressed as

$$
\theta = \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
$$

where

- $\theta$ is the parameter vector
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $J(\theta)$ is the cost function
- $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$ is the gradient of the cost function

The gradient of the cost function w.r.t. to the intercept $\theta_0$
and the coefficient $\theta_1$ are expresed as the following.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{\theta_0} J(\theta) &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i) \\
\nabla_{\theta_1} J(\theta) &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i) x \\
\end{aligned}
$$

For more details, please refer to the [Mathematics of Gradient Descent](/posts/mathematics-of-gradient-descent) post.

## Implemetation of Batch Gradient Descent

First, define the prediction function.

```python
def predict(intercept, coefficient, dataset):
  return intercept + coefficient * x
```

Second, determine the prediction error and the gradient of the cost function w.r.t the intercept $\theta_0$ and the coefficient $\theta_1$.

```python
length = len(x)
error = prediction - y

intercept_gradient = np.sum(error) / length
coefficient_gradient = np.sum(error * x) / length
```

Lastly, update the intercept $\theta_0$ and the coefficient $\theta_1$.

```python
intercept = intercept - alpha * intercept_gradient
coefficient = coefficient - alpha * coefficient_gradient
```

## Conclusion

![Regression line animation](/assets/posts/batch-gradient-descent/bgd.gif "Regression line animation")

From the graph above, we can see that how the regression line changes from the time to time.
After $10,000$ iterations, the MSE value of our own Gradient Descent is $0.195$ which is quite close to our baseline, $0.191$.

Here are some keypoints for Batch Gradient Descent:

1. Batch Gradient Descent only updates the parameters once after considering all the data points. Thus, it takes longer time for the algorithm to converge.
2. Not only does it takes longer to converge, but it also takes up a lot of computational resources.
3. Batch Gradient Descent is not the best algorithm for large datasets.

## Code

```python
def bgd(x, y, epochs, df, alpha = 0.01):
  intercept, coefficient = 2.0, -7.5
  length = len(x)

  predictions = predict(intercept, coefficient, x)
  error = predictions - y
  mse = np.sum(error ** 2) / (2 * length)
  df.loc[0] = [intercept, coefficient, mse]

  for epoch in range(1, epochs):
    predictions = predict(intercept, coefficient, x)
    error = predictions - y
    intercept_gradient = np.sum(error) / length
    coefficient_gradient = np.sum(error * x) / length
    intercept = intercept - alpha * intercept_gradient
    coefficient = coefficient - alpha * coefficient_gradient
    mse = np.sum(error ** 2) / (2 * length)
    df.loc[epoch] = [intercept, coefficient, mse]
  return df
```
